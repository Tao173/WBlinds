### Hardware
These are some suggestions for hardware to use. The first link in each row is the product I used for the prototype. All links are non-affiliate and can be found elsewhere if you look around. Prices are estimates including shipping at the time I purchased and may have changed since then; I suggest searching around if so.

### Circuit
I've created PCBs that fit the components, but am still tweaking it -- the designs will be included in `etc/` when ready. For now, these pretty pictures might help you create your own perfboard/breadboard circuits.
> If anyone has experience designing PCBs and is interested in helping out, please contact me!

<img src="./etc/circuit.png" alt="logo">

* **Remember to [adjust the current limit](https://youtu.be/89BHS9hfSUk) of the A4988 BEFORE connecting it to the circuit** -- keep the magic smoke inside.
* The pins can be set via the [web UI](#settings), feel free to use different ones.
* Be sure not to apply 12/24V to your ESP or `Vc` (or VDD) of the driver IC. It only goes to `Vm` to power the motor, everything else can use 3.3v.
* A4988's `RST` and `SLP` can be connected to each other if you don't care about the ability to sleep the motor.

### Software
1. Connect ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. `git clone https://github.com/maxakuru/WBlinds.git`
3. `cd WBlinds && yarn`
4. `yarn build`
5. `yarn flash`
6. On first boot an access point will be started, connect to it:
    * SSID: `WBlinds-XXXXXX`
    * Default password: `Wbl1nds-1337`
7. After connecting, a webpage should open to configure settings. If not, go to http://4.3.2.1/settings?type=gen
8. Configure SSID, password, pins, etc. and tap "SAVE"
9. You will be disconnected from the AP. Find the IP address of the device on your network and enter it in your browser.
> Steps 3-5 assume you have PlatformIO, Node.js, Yarn installed. You can also flash without Node/Yarn by using the [PlatformIO VSCode Plugin](#tools).

### MQTT
WBlinds subscribes to a wildcard based on the topic provided.
For example, a topic name `blinds/living_room` will subscribe to `blinds/living_room/#`.

The topic defines a number of actions without any payload, for example:
```sh
topic="blinds/living_room/up"
```
```sh
topic="blinds/living_room/down"
```
```sh
topic="blinds/living_room/stop"
```
```sh
topic="blinds/living_room/sleep"
```

Some topics can specify additional data:
```sh
topic="blinds/living_room/move"
body="{\"pos\":50,\"speed\":1000,\"accel\":1000}"
```
Where `pos` is %, `speed` is Hz, and `accel` is steps/s^2.

### Homekit
Native Homekit integration allows the ESP32 to be detected as a device without a bridge/emulator. This mode requires percentage-based position values, so it's important to calibrate the settings first.

### Home

<h2 id="configuration">üîß Configuration</h2>

There are a few ways to configure WBlinds. Eventually the goal is to provide a way to easily calibrate top and bottom ranges of the blinds, but for now the distances are either manually set or (by default) calculated from configuration values.

### Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `DEFAULT_STEPS_PER_REV` | Steps per revolution, varies from motor to motor. May be defined as step angle, in which case you can divide 360/stepAngle for the steps/rev | `200` (1.8¬∞) |
| `DEFAULT_CORD_LENGTH_MM` | Length of the cord or material that wraps around the axis, in millimeters. Used to calculate maximum turns to fully wrap around axis. | `1650` |
| `DEFAULT_CORD_DIAMETER_MM` | Diameter of the cord or material, in millimeters. Used to calculate maximum turns to fully wrap around axis. | `0.1` |
| `DEFAULT_AXIS_DIAMETER_MM` | Diameter of the axis the motor turns, in millimeters. Default is the approx size of the stl in `etc/` | `15` |

### Default Pins
| Pin | Use | Description
| --- | --- | -----------|
| `18`  | pDir | Controls direction (optional) |
| `19`  | pStep | Controls steps via PWM with A4988 (required) |
| `21`  | pSlp | Allows putting motor to sleep to save most power possible. (optional) |
| `23`  | pEn | Allows enabling/disabling motor with A4988. By default the motor is disabled and enabled between uses which lowers power consumption. (optional)
| `3` | pRst | Reset pin (optional)
| `1` | pMs1 | Microstep resolution pin 1, using microsteps can decrease sound (optional)
| `5` | pMs2 | Microstep resolution pin 2 (optional)
| `17` | pMs3 | Microstep resolution pin 3 (optional)
| `4` | pHomeSw | Home trigger switch, recommended as a way to hard stop when the blinds reach the fully contracted position to avoid damaging hardware when steps are skipped or malfunctions. (optional)

<h2 id="development">üìù Development</h2>

There are 2 main projects that make up this repo: the C++ ESP controller and a TypeScript-based web UI. The web UI is transpiled to Javascript and gzipped/chunked into header files with a script. All generated header files as well as transpiled JS is included in the repo, so no additional build steps are needed.

### Scripts
Build web UI in development/watch mode (outputs to `public/`):
```sh
yarn dev
```

Build web UI minified (outputs to `public/`):
```sh
yarn build:ui
```

Generate header files from `public/`:
```sh
yarn build:uih
```

The previous 2 scripts can be combined with:
```sh
yarn build
```


The following scripts depend on PlatformIO, and can be replaced with the toolbar quick actions in VSCode if you prefer.

Compile C++ (assumes *nix machine right now):
```sh
yarn build:cpp
```

Build & flash using pio:
```sh
yarn flash
```

### Tools
I recommend using VSCode to build/flash. Eventually I plan to cut releases of precompiled binary that can be flashed directly, but for the time being you'll need to pull the code and compile it yourself. That is made very simple by the wonderful [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - I highly recommend using it with their [VSCode plugin](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).

There are some other suggested plugins in the `.vscode` directory; VSCode should suggest installing any missing plugin on first boot, but none are required.

### Custom integrations
Additional integrations can be built in by extending the `StateObserver` class and attaching to it, specifying the event flags you are interested in.

```cpp
#include "defines.h"
#include "state.h"
#include <SpecialLib.h>

class SpecialLibIntegration : protected StateObserver {
public:
    explicit SpecialLibIntegration() {
        EventFlags flags;
        flags.pos_ = true;
        flags.speed_ = true;
        flags.accel_ = true;
        flags.targetPos_ = true;
        State::getInstance()->Attach(this, flags);
    };
    ~SpecialLibIntegration() override {
        specialLib.teardown();
        state_.Detach(this);
    };
}
```

<h2 id="appendix">üí§ Appendix</h2>

### Other files
The `/etc` directory contains some STL files that may be useful for building WBlinds. Those are designed for use with IKEA HOPPVALS, but would be close to the TRIPPVALS, too.
> Note: Like everything else, those designs are a WIP :)
